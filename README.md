# Tourney TV
### Full Stack Web Application designed and developed by [Chhaian Pin](http://chhaianpin.herokuapp.com)

## Premise
Minimal viable product of a full-stack volleyball tournament web application
that allows volleyball tournament managers to schedule volleyball games,
organize tournament details, and manage the logistics and information of the
tournament event. Users are able to register a profile, update their player
information, and if authorized, allowed to keep track of active game scores.
This web application helps administer a volleyball tournament from a central
location and allows users the ability to update and inform changing content in
real time.
