# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# require 'faker'
#
# 4.times do
#   Player.create(
#     username: Faker::DcComics.hero,
#     password: "123"
#   )
# end

# count = 1
# team1 = Team.find(1)
# team2 = Team.find(2)
# while (count <= 12) do
#   if (count <= 6)
#     player = Player.find(count)
#     team1.players << player
#   else
#     player = Player.find(count)
#     team2.players << player
#   end
#   count += 1
# end


# team3 = Team.find(3)
# team4 = Team.find(4)
# for i in 13..24 do
#   if (i < 19)
#     team3.players << Player.find(i)
#   else
#     team4.players << Player.find(i)
